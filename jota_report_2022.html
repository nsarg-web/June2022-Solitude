<h1>JOTA 2022</h1>
October 14th to  16th 2022
Another great weekend was had at Overstone Scout Ground for the 65th Jamboree on the air. Scouts from across Northamptonshire, gathered to camp and undertake a weekend of activities alongside a fully operational Amateur radio Station working on HF (Cobweb, G5RV and Longwire Antenna) VHF / UHF (Co- Linear and Discone) and Satellites (QFH Antenna) as well as Skype allowing contacts around the world and locally. Using SSB, Morse, FT8 and Digital modes.
A highlight of the weekend was being able to work the GB100BBC special event station to commemorate 100 years of the BBC.
Scouts were able to practice their French, German and Spanish as they had their first taste of the hobby.
We are very grateful to our friends at Amphenol for their continued support and sponsorship with the event.
