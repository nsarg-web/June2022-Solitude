      <h3 class="green margin_websdr">A quick start guide to using an on-line (WebSDR) radio receiver to 
listen to Amateur Radio transmissions.
<br></h3>
<h2>What is a WebSDR?</h2>
<br>
<h4 class="margin_websdr"> WebSDR is a Software-Defined Radio receiver connected to the internet which allows many users
to control it and to listen to radio broadcasts simultaneously. You can literally tune around the radio 
spectrum using you’re your own computer (connected to the internet) and a web browser.
There are many WebSDR receivers out there but for the purpose of this guide I’m going to use the 
one hosted by the University of Twente in the Netherlands. This site is located in Europe so has good 
reception of a range of stations and it covers a wide range of frequencies from Long Wave (LW) and 
Medium Wave (MW) up to the Short Waves…you may recognise these terms from your normal 
household radios. </h4>
<h2 class="green">Start here</h2>
<h4 class="margin_websdr">Start by pointing your favourite web browser to
<a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/" class="btn btn-primary enabled" tabindex="-1" role="button" aria-disabled="true">University of Twente in the Netherlands.</a>


  You should find a web page that looks like the picture below (once you get past the pictures and text at the top of the 
page).<br>

<img src="/Images/picture/websdr/WebSDR-full-view.jpg">
    </div>
    <h4 class="margin_websdr">Although the web page can look a bit confusing when you first arrive, with numerous controls, there 
are actually only a few key things you need to know to get listening.
As soon as you load the page you should start hearing the hiss of radio reception…right now you<q></q> 
probably not tuned into anything. If you don<q></q>t hear any noise or if the large <q>waterfall</q>  is not moving.
Click the button displayed towards the top left. It is marked <button>Audio Start Button.</button>
❷is not being displayed then look at the control labelled ❶ and select Java instead of HTML5.

Note that the interface presented to phone users is much simpler than that presented to 
users on tablets and computers but the basic controls and method of tuning is exactly the 
same. WebSDR viewed on an iPhone The colourful area labelled ❷is known as the waterfall and this is a graphical representation of the 
radio signals being received across the spectrum. We can use this to spot where radio signals are to 
help tune in on them. This section should constantly be scrolling upward and, in that way, we see 
not only a real time visual picture of signals on the radio spectrum but also the last 5 – 10 seconds of 
history. We can scroll up and down the spectrum by hovering the mouse over the waterfall and left 
clicking and then moving sideways (either left or right) while holding down the left mouse button. 
The frequency that you can actually hear is indicated by the little yellow marker at the bottom edge 
of the waterfall . Similarly, to tune in a signal this can be <q>grabbed</q> using the mouse and moved 
left and right.
Fine tuning by using the mouse to move the yellow tuning marker can be tricky so control ❸allows 
us to type a frequency directly into the control box and provides buttons to tune up (+, ++ & +++) or 
down (-, --, &---) in small medium or large steps. The buttons below this that say </h4>

<h4 class="margin_websdr"> Reception modes; you may have come across the term FM while using your car radio 
or AM on your home stereo. For now, we won’t worry about what these mean but the follow 
examples will simply use AM and LSB.
Nearly there! One last control before we start…the Waterfall Zoom, ❹, allows us to zoom in on a 
close-up view of a specific frequency or zoom out to speed up tuning around.</h4>



<h3 class="green">Tuning in our first station</h3>

<h4 class="margin_websdr"> Let’s start by tuning in a loud broadcast station. These are commercial stations like the BBC or Radio 
China International.
In the tuning control, ❸, type 7300 and hit enter. This will move the yellow tuning indicator to the 
frequency 7300kHz or 7.3MHz which is near the middle of the 41m (41 metre) broadcast band. 
Select the AM mode, button below where you just entered the frequency. Press the Waterfall 
Zoom❹+ control about 5 times to start with. You should see something like the image below 
and may already be hearing a radio station. If the tuning indicator is not roughly centre of screen use 
you mouse to select the waterfall and drag it left or right to centre things. Remember, hover over 
the waterfall before left clicking not the yellow tuning indicator…if you click on that and drag you will 
retune to another frequency.
<img src="/Images/picture/websdr/waterfall.jpg">
You’ll notice in the black space under the waterfall there are two frequency ranges marked out. 
‘40m amateur’ in green and ‘41m broadcast’ in purple. This highlights where you can hear Amateur 
Radio stations and commercial broadcast stations…there are many such ‘bands’ of activity and 
details are included in the ‘Further Information’ section at the end of this guide. The bright and 
sometimes fuzzy vertical lines on the waterfall are radio broadcasts. The brighter the line the 
stronger the signal.
If you zoom in further (press the Waterfall Zoom❹ + control another 3 or 4 times) you’ll see 
lots of orange markers appear. These identify the broadcast stations that have regular scheduled 
transmissions on a frequency. These broadcast stations do not necessarily transmit 24/7 and 
typically have scheduled transmissions in different languages depending on the target audience.
Evenings are a good time to hear broadcasts on this band.
If you’re not already able to hear a station reasonably clearly try dragging the yellow tuning indicator 
left and right or use the +++ & --- tuning controls in ❸(note, if you try dragging the yellow tuning 
indicator and it simply gets wider it’s because you’ve grabbed the wrong bit! Try and click on the top 
edge of it and not the sides. If you do this simply press the AM button again to reset the size of the 
tuning indicator). You may have noticed that when you selected the AM button the yellow tuning
indicator got much wider. Check it out, select LSB then AM and see the difference. This represents 
the bandwidth of the received signal. 
In the frequency range indicated by the purple zone (41m broadcast) you should see several bright 
vertical bands on the waterfall. To tune into a station move the yellow tuning marker until it is 
centred on the transmission (the bright vertical band). The width of the bright line scrolling up the 
waterfall should be similar to the width of the yellow tuning indicator. 
[Note: if you are not seeing any broad, bright lines like those in the picture above try again during 
the evening when reception of broadcast stations tends to be better.]
In the image below we can see two stations; one centred on 7285kHz and one at 7300kHz. 
<!--Image is required for the details below-->


<h2>Image needed here</h2> 

<h4 class="margin_websdr">The width 
of the signal in the waterfall depends a little on the transmission…here the station on the left has 
someone talking and the station on the right is playing music
Congratulations, you’ve just tuned in your first radio station on a WebSDR! Spend a moment to 
experiment…tune in other stations and see what you can hear. What does it sound like if the tuning 
indicator is not quite aligned with the line in the waterfall? Zoom in and out and use your mouse to 
drag the waterfall left and right to see different parts of the spectrum display.</h4>

If you're having any problems watch this short video 
https://youtu.be/v1u2tUzV-s0
It demonstrates entering a frequency, selecting AM, zooming in on the waterfall and selecting 
different AM broadcasts either by dragging the yellow tuning indicator or by directly entering the 
frequency.

<h2>Listening to Amateur Radio transmissions</h2>
<h4 class="margin_websdr"> Now you’ve learned how to use the WebSDR receiver let’s find some Amateur Radio transmissions 
for you to hear. We’re going to look for voice conversations (Amateurs also use Morse code and a 
mix of historic and cutting edge data modes) and hopefully something in your native language. 
We’re going to try listening to the 40m amateur band as this is most likely to have activity at any 
time of the day.
In the tuning control, ❸, type 7100 and hit enter. This will move the yellow tuning indicator to the 
frequency 7100kHz or 7.1MHz which is the middle of the 40m amateur band. Voice transmissions 
can normally be heard from 7050 – 7200kHz. Like business, English is the predominant language 
used where the Radio Amateurs are in different countries but Amateur Radio is a global interest and 
you can hear every language if you tune around long enough.
If signals are present you’ll see they are a different size and shape to the broadcast stations. They 
are much narrower than your tuning indicator and far more sharply defined. This is because Radio 
Amateurs are using LSB on this band, a narrower bandwidth mode which concentrates their 
transmission energy into a smaller bandwidth.
In the tuning control, ❸, select the LSB button and either use the + /- buttons or drag the 
yellow tuning indicator to align with a signal in the waterfall display.
Do the voices sound like they’ve been inhaling helium or like they’re muffled/garbled? You’ll need to 
be much more accurate with your tuning compared to AM. These voice signals are roughly 2.4kHz 
wide and, to generate the most powerful signal while remaining intelligible, only a part of the 
normal voice range is used (say ~300Hz to 2700kHz) which means the voices you hear won’t sound 
deep and rich like they do on your local FM radio stations and, similarly, would sound awful if you 
tried to play music as there are no higher frequencies…Radio Amateurs are not permitted to 
broadcast music so this is never really an issue!
Hopefully your display looks something like this (notice the little vertical bar in the yellow tuning 
indicator is aligned with the right-hand edge of the LSB signal)</h4>

<img src="/Images/picture/websdr/tuner.jpg">
<h4 class="margin_websdr">
Experiment by trying to select several different Amateur Radio transmissions and get used to 
adjusting the tuning indicator so the received voice is understandable. Hurrah, we’re listening to 
Radio Amateurs talking to each other…but what are they saying? There seems to be lots of letters 
and numbers and I can only hear one person talking
The Radio Amateur Exchange
First things first, the conversation you’re listening to now is what we call simplex which means only 
one person can talk at a time. This is because we’re using a single frequency and you are either 
transmitting or receiving…if you’ve ever used a walkie talkie or CB you’ll have experienced this. It’s 
possible that you may only be able to hear one side of the conversation if the second station is not 
also in range of the WebSDR receiver.
A big part of Amateur Radio is the self-training in radio communications. This isn’t like talking on the 
phone where you can clearly hear the other person including when they laugh, mumble, gasp and 
whisper. Radio communication paths can be noisy, they can suffer interference from other 
transmissions or electrical noises, they’re narrow band (remember I said only a small range of the 
voice frequencies are transmitted) and the person you’re talking to may not share the same native 
language. To overcome this Radio Amateurs learn a specific way of communicating to ensure what 
they say is clear and understandable no matter what the reception conditions.
Here is an example of what you might hear;

<h4 class="margin_websdr purple">
“Oscar Echo Four Hotel Delta Sierra this is Golf Zero Papa Oscar Tango. Many thanks for the call old 
man. The name here is Michael and the QTH is Thatcham, that’s Tango Hotel Alpha Tango Charlie 
Hotel Alpha Mike about 70km west of London. Your signal report here is five and seven, five and 
seven with some QSB. I wonder how you’re copying me? Oscar Echo Four Hotel Delta Sierra this is 
Golf Zero Papa Oscar Tango”</h4>

<h4 class="margin_websdr">So what was that all about?!!
“Oscar Echo Four Hotel Delta Sierra this is Golf Zero Papa Oscar Tango”
You have to be ‘licensed’ to operate as a Radio Amateur. You first undertake some simple training 
and a basic exam to check your understanding and then you are issued a call-sign (in the UK this is 
issued by OFCOM). Your call-sign is unique to you and its prefix indicates your country. In the above 
example OE4HDS is a Radio Amateur from Austria being called by G0POT from the UK. When 
establishing a contact (and regularly throughout the exchange) the two stations will give their call 
signs to identify themselves (it’s a licencing requirement…broadcast stations have to do the same 
which is why they regularly play jingles with their station name every 30 minutes or more). But 
rattling off “OE4HDS” may be difficult for other stations to hear and understand therefore,</h4>

  Using important but unusual words like call signs, names and locations you will hear stations spelling 
    them out using Phonetics
    <a href="'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet" class="btn btn-primary enabled" tabindex="-2" role="button" aria-disabled="true">NATO_phonetic_alphabet Explained.</a>
<br>
“Many thanks for the call old man”
That’s a bit rude isn’t it, calling him an <q></q>old man<q></q>? Actually, no…this is an endearing way to address 
someone when you don’t know their name yet. 
“The name here is Michael and the QTH is Thatcham that’s Tango Hotel Alpha Charlie Hotel Alpha 
Mike about 70km west of London”
Typically the first things exchanged are ones name and location. If reception isn’t strong or if an 
operator has an unusual name they will typically spell that out using phonetics. Most Radio 
Amateurs use NATO Phonetics but you’ll hear lots of random words used when spelling words with 
phonetics! QTH is another way of saying my location…there are many ‘Q codes’
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code" class="btn btn-primary enabled" tabindex="-2" role="button" aria-disabled="true">
  Q codes explained.</a>
<br>
 Using Q codes can help when reception is poor or 
when you are speaking to someone who is not a native of your language. Only a small subset of Q
codes are regularly heard in use. As we’re often in communication with people from outside of our 
country it can help to qualify ones location by indicating your position in relation to the capital or 
simply that you are in the north/south of the country. Amateur Radio is great for learning 
geography!
“Your signal report here is five and seven, five and seven with some QSB”
To help you understand how well you are being heard at the other end Radio Amateurs exchange 
‘signal reports’. For voice communications this is usually two numbers (5 and 7 in this example). The 
first number is Readability (R) and is on a scale from 1 – 5. The second number is signal Strength (S) 
and is on a scale from 1 – 9. This approach to signal measurement is called RST 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RST_code" class="btn btn-primary enabled" tabindex="-2" role="button" aria-disabled="true">
  RST codes explained.</a>
the T or Tone part only applies when using Morse code.
“I wonder how you’re copying me? Oscar Echo Four Hotel Delta Sierra this is Golf Zero Papa Oscar 
Tango”
Just like the beginning of the ‘over’ at the end Radio Amateurs will typically exchange call signs again 
so that it is clear who is handing over to whom. Here the station is asking how he is being ‘copied’ 
e.g. he wants to know his signal report or RST.

Broadcast radio) using WebSDR. See the tables below which list the other Amateur Radio bands on 
Short Wave along with the Broadcast bands. There are also links to many other information
