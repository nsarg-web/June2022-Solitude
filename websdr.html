        <h4> People around the world have set up their radio receivers (and antenna) to be accessible over the Internet. The upshot of this means that you can take 
          control of other people’s receivers around the world, and listen in to the frequencies that they can receive.
          
          <q>WebSDRs</q> support multiple connections, 
          This allows a number of people access the receiver, tuning to their preferred frequency, 
          whilst others are listening to different frequencies.
        </p>
          Why is this useful?
          Several reasons:</h4>

      WebSDR  <q>Software-Defined Radio</q> is a webbased receiver, allowing many listeners to listen and tune it simultaneously. SDR technology makes it 
      possible for all listeners to tune independently, 
      and thus listen to different signals.
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="finding">
      <h4 class="margin_websdr">There are active receivers around the world, Some of them are provided by radio enthusists, there are several locatated at famous listening stations.  Jodrell Bank in Cheshire, 
        Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall.  
         allowing a user to tune the receiver in real time, as if they were sitting infront of the radio at the selected location.
        Part of the Activity badge requirements the participant is required to log a number of Amateur Radio Transmissions. Using one of the many Web SDR receivers 
        they can gain experiance with tuning the various receivers around the world to complete the logging requirements. 
      </h4>
      <h4 class="margin_websdr"> A list of active receivers can be found on the websdr organisation website at <a><a class="btn btn-success" href="https://www.websdr.org">Websdr</a> there are currently over 100 stations in the List.

        User simply select the receiver Location from the active stations. The list of stations can be filtered to show stations in a geographical area.

        Using WebSDR the user is able to view the signals received at one location
      Then view a different receiver from another station located in a different part of the Globe</div>

What is a WebSDR?
People around the world have set up their radio receivers (and antenna) to be accessible over the Internet. The upshot of this means that you can take control of other people’s receivers around the world, and listen in to the frequencies that they can receive.

WebSDRs support multiple connections, so loads of people can access the receiver, tuning to their preferred frequency, whilst others are listening to different frequencies.

Why is this useful?
Several reasons:

Great for newcomers to listen to amateur signals without purchasing an expensive receiver or setting up an antenna
You can use it to check out your own signal – discover how your signal sounds on-air
Listen to signals that your own equipment can’t receive
Pull in a weak signal by listening using someone else’s antenna
See how an entire band (or set of bads) looks visually
See how active the bands are around the world
Learn about software defined radios without buying one
WebSDRs can tune to a range of frequencies, not just the ham bands
How can I access and control an SDR?
All you need is a computer, Internet connection and speakers – just using most standard web browsers

Where can I try an SDR?
In the UK, probably the most well-known is the “Hack Green SDR”. This is at the site of a decommissioned ex-cold war nuclear bunker in Nantwich, Cheshire. Click the following link: hackgreensdr.org:8901
Where can I find WebSDRs?
There is a great directory of worldwide WedSDRs here: websdr.org

Can I create my own WebSDR?
Yes – cheaply and easily. If you have a Raspberry Pi computer and an SDR dongle, you can set up your own WebSDR. We’ll be adding an article on how to do this shortly
